trane is a SAX-style parser for real-world, i.e. broken, HTML. It is
written in Erlang.

It aims to behave like browser HTML parsers, i.e. to turn anything
into an HTML parse tree. If the HTML is broken, this is of course
totally unpredictable, and all browsers does it differently.

The name is an homage to John Coltrane, another quality sax wielder.
